MabiPale2
==============================

MabiPale is a packet logger for the online-game Mabinogi.

Unlike its first version, Pale now requires a packet provider that is
compatible to mod_Alissa. Valid canditates would be "Morrighan", a kind of
Mabinogi proxy that can be found on the Aura forum, or mod_Alissa itself.
